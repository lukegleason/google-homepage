Purpose of this project is so I will show and further my HTML/CSS knowledge.

Thoughts from this project (11/10/19)
* I didn't 'absorb' much of the html/css, and only truly knew the barebone basics
* Positioning elements was what I struggled with the most, took a lot of googling to figure it out.
* I was able to place the 'backbone' of the site fairly easily with html, but I moreso had a hard time with css.
